# Slide 1 — Problem in One Picture
- Greece has the highest locked-stock share in Europe (σ ≈ 34.5%): ~1 in 3 homes exists but is unavailable → artificial scarcity.
- Locked stock alone makes the market behave as if demand were 50% higher.
- EU comparison (σ): Greece 34.5%, Germany ~10%, Netherlands ~8%, UK ~12%, France ~11%, Spain ~13%, Italy ~14%, Portugal ~15%.

# Slide 2 — Core Mechanism (σ → F → P)
- Locked stock share: $\sigma = \frac{S_{\text{locked}}}{S_{\text{total}}}$
- Friction factor: $F = \frac{1}{1 - \sigma}$
- Price with friction: $P \propto \frac{D}{S_{\text{total}}} \cdot F$
Locked stock behaves like a demand multiplier; at σ = 0.35, $F \approx 1.53$ (prices act as if demand were ~53% higher).

# Slide 3 — Baseline Friction Geography
![](../outputs/choropleth_municipalities.png)
- Extreme σ in islands / coastal tourism belts (> 0.60).
- Northern Aegean, Cyclades, Ionian show deep red clusters.
- Attica looks “green” because high churn keeps STRs from fully dominating.
- Locked stock alone drives effective demand inflation without population growth.

# Slide 4 — EU Benchmark Classification
![](../outputs/choropleth_archetypes.png)
- Six EU buckets: Efficient (1), Normal (17), Mediterranean Acceptable (34), Elevated Friction (37), Structural Dysfunction (109), Market Collapse (135).
- Only ~11% of municipalities meet European efficiency norms (σ < 0.15).
- Greece is a structural outlier in EU housing performance.

# Slide 5 — Unlock Simulation (20%)
![](../outputs/unlock_effect_collage_alt.png)
- Uniform 20% unlock of locked stock → price drops roughly 20–60% in constrained markets.
- Zero new construction; purely unlocking existing stock.
- Shows how friction relief alone can restore affordability.

\newpage

# Slide 6 — Policy Levers
- Tourist belts → STR / second-home caps + local occupancy obligations.
- Transitional areas → tax/regulatory incentives to bring locked stock to market.
- Structural Dysfunction → legal/administrative clean-up; tackle “zombie” titles.
- Attica & healthy cores → protect mobility and transparency, avoid new frictions.
- Unlocking even 20% of locked stock delivers order-of-magnitude affordability gains.
