# Slide 1 — Title + Problem Statement
- Title: "Housing Friction Atlas: Mapping Greece’s Locked Stock Crisis"
- Greece has the highest locked-stock share in Europe (σ ≈ 34.5%).
- About 1 in 3 homes physically exists but is unavailable → artificial scarcity.
- EU comparison (σ): Greece 34.5%, Germany ~10%, Netherlands ~8%, UK ~12%, France ~11%, Spain ~13%, Italy ~14%, Portugal ~15%.

# Slide 2 — Core Mechanism (σ → F → Prices)
- Locked stock share: $\sigma = \frac{S_{\text{locked}}}{S_{\text{total}}}$
- Friction factor: $F = \frac{1}{1 - \sigma}$
- F acts like a demand multiplier (σ = 0.35 → F ≈ 1.53).

# Slide 3 — Baseline Friction Map

- Extreme σ in islands / coastal tourism belts (> 0.60).
- Attica looks “green” because high churn keeps STRs from fully dominating.
- Locked stock alone makes markets behave as if demand were ~50% higher.

# Slide 4 — EU Benchmark Categories
![](../outputs/choropleth_eu_benchmark.png)
- Only 11% of Greek municipalities meet European efficiency norms.
- EU benchmark categories (n = 333):
  - European Efficient (1)
  - European Normal (17)
  - Mediterranean Acceptable (34)
  - Elevated Friction (37)
  - Structural Dysfunction (105)
  - Market Collapse (131)
- Message: Greece behaves like a structurally distorted outlier in the EU housing system.

# Slide 5 — Unlock Simulation (20% reduction)
![](../outputs/unlock_effect_collage.png)
- Simulated 20% reduction in σ in every municipality (uniform unlock).
- Constrained markets see price drops from about −20% to −60%.
- Achieved without new construction: purely by unlocking existing stock.

# Slide 6 — Policy Levers
- Tourist belts → STR / second-home caps + local occupancy obligations.
- Transitional areas → tax/regulatory incentives to bring locked stock to market.
- Structural Dysfunction → legal/administrative clean-up; tackle “zombie” titles.
- Attica & healthy cores → protect mobility and transparency, avoid new frictions.
- Unlocking even 20% of locked stock delivers order-of-magnitude affordability gains.
